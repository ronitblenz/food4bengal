<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About the Project

**"Someone's waste is, Someone else"s treasure"** , Let's bridge the gap between the **"50 plate bachh gaye bhaiya, abb kya kare?"** and **"Khaane ke liye paisa nhi hai"**.

-  Food being the topper among the survival apparent leaderboard. Unknowningly we overlook the wastage of the reason to live. 

## 💡The problem : Food wastage


-  ### Case 1 :  Restaurant food wastage

Here are some common causes of food wastage in restaurants and strategies to address them are: 

    - Overproduction
    - Poor inventory management
    - Inaccurate forecasting
    - Plate waste
    - Inefficient food preparation


-  ### Case 2: Food delivery wastage

Food delivery waste refers to the inefficiencies and environmental impact associated with the management and execution of delivery services.It encompasses various aspects,including:

    - Packaging waste
    - Transportation inefficiencies
    - Excess inventory
    - Improper disposal of materials.
  

    
-  ### Case 3 : Social Gathering food wastage
Food waste at such gatherings can be significant and contribute to environmental and economic challenges.

    - Overestimation of quantities
    - Uneaten or forgotten food
    - Inadequate food storage and preservation
    - Limited options for left over management

-  ### Case 4 : Household food wastage
 Household food waste is a significant issue worldwide, contributing to economic, environmental, and social challenges. Here are some common reasons for household food waste:

    - Over-purchasing and poor planning
    - Preference for freshness and aesthetics
    - Misinterpretation of expiration dates
    - Lack of awareness and knowledge


## 💡The solution : Food waste management
- Defeating Hunger for the people in need.
- Saving Food from being wasted.
- Cycle of Organic nutrients gets more stable. 
- Reduction of Pollution. 

<br> By managing food wastage, we can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable world, where resources are used efficiently, hunger is reduced, and the environment is protected. It requires collective efforts from **individuals, households, businesses, and Governments** to implement strategies for prevention, recovery, and responsible consumption throughout the food system. Millions of people around the world suffer from malnutrition and lack access to an adequate food supply. 


## 🙌Overview 
- Authentication is done using **Google** and **Facebook** passport.js strategies.
- The user lands up on a page, which asks for a **"Aadhar Number"** for verification **which is a must**.
- Home pagegives a walkthrough to the users for the NGOs that are listed and also the campaigns which are being conducted.
- Each NGO page can be visited given that user can choose roles in the form of **Donor** or **Volunteer**.
- After a specific donation request is placed it updates  the user's donation count in a database.<br>

## 💀 Challenges we ran into:
  - During Aadhar verification, we initially faced a few problems regarding API.  
  - Also we faced some issues with facebook authentication.
  - At the time of deployment of converting MERN app to vercel ,we had faced a problem linking the backend.
 
### 🔮 What's Next For Our Project:
- We have planned some new features to add in our app in future, like e-KYC 
of Aadhar Card with the help of OTP verification.
- And the second thing we want to introduce is **HELP COINS** which will be earn by the Volunteer as well as donor and they can redeem this coins in different shopping places and stores for their need.
